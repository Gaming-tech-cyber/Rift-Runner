# Premise
You’re a Rift Runner defending a jittery Core Shard across alien planets overrun by grotesque, three-eyed green men (now the Ethereals). These foes spit acid, and some jump out with jumpscares to mess with your strategy. The Overmind’s dry humor contrasts the chaos, while energy fields adapt to the madness.
